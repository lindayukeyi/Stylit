# Stylit
We developed an authoring tool that can reflect the designed visual effect to the model, based on the paper *Stylit: illumination-guided example-based stylization of  3d renderings* [Fiˇser et al. 2016]. The tool can provide an artistic visual effect for 3D models, including complex objects like landscape, with very low cost, especially suitable for independent developers. Users just need to render five LPE images and draw a very simple “sphere on the table” scene, then a synthesized artistic image with adjustable resolution and size can be generated. 

## Workflow
### STEP1: Gnererate LPEs
1. Open the default ‘scene.mb’  
2. Load your custom 3D scene
